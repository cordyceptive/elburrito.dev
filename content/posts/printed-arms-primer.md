A brief explainer on the state-of-the-art in printed firearms.

## Can 3D printers produce a useful firearm?
Yes. Caveat: no useful firearm is *entirely* plastic. Or, any entirely-plastic firearm will be extremely limited in firing multiple shots.

The most advanced printed firearm you can make is the FGC-9 pistol-caliber carbine. It can be made with a $200 3D printer, parts you can buy at any hardware store, and actual firearm parts you can buy online. Check out the [release trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zabSOHd0Ag) for a quick look at what it can do.

I am claiming the FGC-9 as the most advanced printed firearm because it's comparable to a "real" manufactured pistol-caliber carbine due to the advanced home manufacturing techniques developed for it. Most notably, the FGC-9 developers created a technique for rifling a barrel at home using electrochemical machining and 3D printed parts. A rifled barrel will be more accurate than a plain steel pipe, though since I haven't made or tested this technique, I can't quantify the improvement. The FGC-9 also has a high proportion of printed parts, compared to our second category of useful firearm: the printed lower receiver.

A lower receiver is the part of a firearm that contains the trigger mechanism, fire control group, and magazine well. It controls how bullets are fed and fired from the gun. Under current American law, *the lower receiver is the part of the gun that is legally considered the firearm*. And, *lower receivers are 3D-printable*.
