A brief explainer on the state-of-the-art in printed firearms.

## Can 3D printers produce a useful firearm?
Yes. Caveat: no useful firearm is *entirely* plastic. Or, any entirely-plastic firearm will be extremely limited in firing multiple shots.

The most advanced printed firearm you can make is the FGC-9 pistol-caliber carbine. It can be made with a $200 3D printer, parts you can buy at any hardware store, and actual firearm parts you can buy online. Check out the [release trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zabSOHd0Ag) for a quick look at what it can do.
