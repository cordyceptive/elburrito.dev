A brief explainer on the state-of-the-art in printed firearms. 

## DISCLAIMER
DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH IF YOU'RE MAKING A GUN. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES OF THIS INFORMATION. THIS POST IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE 100% ACCURATE.

## Can 3D printers produce a useful firearm?
Yes. Caveat: no useful firearm is *entirely* plastic. Or, any entirely-plastic firearm will be extremely limited in firing multiple shots.

The most advanced printed firearm you can make is the FGC-9 pistol-caliber carbine. It can be made with a $200 3D printer, parts you can buy at any hardware store, and actual firearm parts you can buy online. Check out the [release trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zabSOHd0Ag) for a quick look at what it can do.

I am claiming the FGC-9 as the most advanced printed firearm because it's comparable to a "real" manufactured pistol-caliber carbine due to the advanced home manufacturing techniques developed for it. Most notably, the FGC-9 developers created a technique for rifling a barrel at home using electrochemical machining and 3D printed parts. A rifled barrel will be more accurate than a plain steel pipe, though since I haven't made or tested this technique, I can't quantify the improvement. The FGC-9 also has a high proportion of printed parts, compared to our second category of useful firearm: the printed lower receiver.

A lower receiver is the part of a firearm that contains the trigger mechanism, fire control group, and magazine well. It controls how bullets are fed and fired from the gun. Under current American law, *the lower receiver is the part of the gun that is legally considered the firearm*. And, *lower receivers are 3D-printable*.

## Wow, is this even legal?
Yes, you can make guns at home. But they are legally required to have some metal parts. *That's it.* No serial number necessary. This only applies if you are legally allowed to own a firearm, though! Felons, for example, cannot manufacture firearms for themselves.

The [Gun Control Act of 1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968) states that it isn't illegal to manufacture a firearm *for personal use*. A very relevant law to 3D printing legal firearms is the [Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undetectable_Firearms_Act), which makes owning or manufacturing any firearm undetectable by a walk-through metal detector (so with <105g of steel) illegal. The ATF confirms this in their [FAQ](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/firearm-illegal-if-it-made-plastic).

## Huh? Making guns...at home? Is that possible?
Yep! It's possible with traditional subtractive manufacturing as well as with additive 3D printing. The subtractive way is with an 80% completed lower receiver: drilling holes for a fire control group makes the receiver a functional firearm. 80% lowers and rifle parts kits are not expensive! They start at about $600-$800, but do require some mechanical skill to assemble. Again, the printed arms community also helped improve method: jigs for guiding drill holes are available online, and the [Ghost Gunner](https://ghostgunner.net/) desktop CNC mill can finish a variety of 80% lowers automatically.
