## Employment!
I'm starting work sooner than I thought! Come July 27th, I'll be a part of the Privacy Networking team in the Core Systems product area at Google. I have no idea what this means, but in 8 days I'll know. Very excited to end my long vacation and start thinking with a purpose again!

- Gwern's exploration of [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3) is fascinating. This is a machine intelligence that can simulate human language well enough to be creative! It makes truly novel writing possible. Everyone should try to do some co-writing with GPT-3 and see what you can do, [AIDungeon](aidungeon.io) makes this easy.
