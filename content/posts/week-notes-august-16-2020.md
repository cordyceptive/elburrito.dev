- ["The 3D Printed Gun Isn't Coming. It's Already Here."](https://gen.medium.com/the-3d-printed-gun-isnt-coming-it-s-already-here-6855fd394a47), by Kim Kelly. This is the piece I wish I'd written in June when I presented about printed arms to INTERFACE!
- I had the best burger of my life at [The Blue Door Pub in Minneapolis](https://www.thebdp.com/limited-shutdown-menu). It's called the Mount Blusuvious: ghost pepper cheese melted between two patties, with fried avocado, spicy bacon, and cilantro-lime sauce. It is a burger that demands respect and a slower pace. I love it.
- Professional cycling is crazy right now. The [Criterium du Dauphine](https://www.velonews.com/news/road/dauphine-sepp-kuss-wins-stage-5-martinez-wins-overall/), the last major stage race before the Tour de France, showcased this. Five days of brutal climbing and summit finishes, multiple Tour contenders crashing out, and the end of Team Ineos (formerly Team Sky) dominance. Article probably coming on the Dauphine. All this to say: it's going to be one hell of a Tour.
