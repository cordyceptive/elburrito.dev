## How to watch the Tour de France
The Tour de France is starting in a week!
If you're an American then this is the one time in the year that you'll pay attention to cycling.
Let's review what the race is, and what to pay close attention to.

The Tour de France is one of three Grand Tours in cycling, alongside the Giro de Italia and the Vuelta a Espana.
A Grand Tour is a three-week stage race, where the riders will ride 21 days and get 2 rest days.
They are the most prestigious, and most difficult, races to win.
But if there are 21 days of racing, how does that boil down to one winner?

Okay. There will be 21 winners for each of the 21 days. That's how races work.
But in a stage race (an iterated game!), there's another competition that determines the overall winner.
It's called the General Classification, or GC for short.
*The GC winner of a stage race is the rider who takes the least total time to finish all the stages.*
That's what we care about. It means the winner is the most consistent rider in the Tour.
Or the most well guarded, or the strongest climber, or they have the strongest team.
But they have to be good. 22 teams are chasing that title, each with their own leaders targeting the GC.

Our front-runners this year are Team Jumbo-Visma, who wear yellow and black, and Team Ineos, who wear dark red and black.
Ineos are the Yankees of cycling: they have won the Tour seven out of eight times since 2012.
Their sole leader this year is young superstar Egan Bernal, a Columbian climbing specialist.
Very notably, Ineos have cut past-Tour winners Chris Froome (4x) and Geraint Thomas (1x) from their eight-man squad.
They just couldn't keep up with Jumbo-Visma at the most recent stage race, the Criterium du Dauphine.
Jumbo-Visma is riding with two leaders.
