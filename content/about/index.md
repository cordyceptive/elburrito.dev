Currently: software engineer at Google.

Previously, I graduated from Princeton in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science and a certificate in Technology and Society.

As a programmer, I'm interested in databases, distributed systems, and cloud services.

As a citizen, I'm interested in & reading about tools for autonomy, the American Revolution, and political polarization.

I enjoy riding bicycles and climbing mountains.
